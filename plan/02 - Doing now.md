# SVG
Investigate potential SVG libraries to render graphs. In case you are curious, I'm still working on this! Checkout latest experiment in [vivasvg](https://github.com/anvaka/vivasvg/tree/master/experiments/v0.2)

Update: this initiative is paused due to my personal situation. However I'm trying to improve this bit by bit on a daily basis.
