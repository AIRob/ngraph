Examples in this folder are showing step by step how to implement a graph renderer using [pixi.js](https://github.com/GoodBoyDigital/pixi.js) and `ngraph` modules.

Here is what we've done so far:

* [01. Basic](http://anvaka.github.io/ngraph/examples/pixi.js/01%20-%20Basic/) - Shows basic rendering of a graph. It is simple but does not support any user interactions.
* [02. Basic no inline](http://anvaka.github.io/ngraph/examples/pixi.js/02%20-%20Basic%20No%20Inline/index.html) - Almost the same as the first example, but html page does not inline javascript.
* [03. Zoom and Pan](http://anvaka.github.io/ngraph/examples/pixi.js/03%20-%20Zoom%20And%20Pan/) - Adds basic mouse support, allowing to zoom in on a node and pan entire scene.
* [04 - Node interaction](http://anvaka.github.io/ngraph/examples/pixi.js/04%20-%20Individual%20Node%20Events/) - Everything we've done in examples 01, 02 and 03, plus allows to drag individual graph nodes.
* [05 - Dynamic](http://anvaka.github.io/ngraph/examples/pixi.js/05%20-%20Dynamic/) - Shows how to render a dynamic graph with custom nodes and edges.
