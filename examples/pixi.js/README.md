Examples in this folder are showing step by step how to implement a graph renderer using [pixi.js](https://github.com/GoodBoyDigital/pixi.js) and `ngraph` modules.

Here is what is done so far:

* [01. Basic](http://anvaka.github.io/ngraph/examples/pixi.js/01%20-%20Basic/) - this is basic rendering of a graph. It is simple but does not support any user interactions.
* [02. Basic no inline](http://anvaka.github.io/ngraph/examples/pixi.js/02%20-%20Basic%20No%20Inline/index.html) - this is almost the same as first example, but html pages do not include inline javascript.
* [03. Zoom and Pan](http://anvaka.github.io/ngraph/examples/pixi.js/03%20-%20Zoom%20And%20Pan/) - this example adds basic mouse support, allowing to zoom in on a node and drag entire scene with graph.
* [04 - Node interaction](http://anvaka.github.io/ngraph/examples/pixi.js/04%20-%20Individual%20Node%20Events/) - this example contains everything we've seen in examples 01-03, plus allows to drag individual graph nodes.
